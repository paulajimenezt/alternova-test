# Alternova - Task Manager Program

This repository contains my submission for the technical task assessment for Alternova.

## Project Overview

This project is a task tracking application developed as a monorepo, encompassing both backend and frontend components.

### Backend

The backend is developed using Node.js with Express as the web framework. It employs SQLite as the database and TypeScript for type safety and enhanced developer experience. For detailed information on the backend's technical decisions and implementation, please refer to the README file located in the `/backend` folder.

### Frontend

The frontend is built using React Native with TypeScript, leveraging Expo for streamlined deployment and development. For more details on the frontendâ€™s technical decisions and implementation, please consult the README file located in the `/frontend` folder.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the setup instructions in the respective `/backend` and `/frontend` folders. Each folder contains specific instructions for setting up and running the component locally.

## Folder Structure

- `/backend` - Contains the backend code and related files.
- `/frontend` - Contains the frontend code and related files.

Please note that both the `/backend` and `/frontend` folders include their own README files with comprehensive information on their respective components.
